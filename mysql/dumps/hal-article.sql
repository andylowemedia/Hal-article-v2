Former Vice President Joe Biden has seen his position there slide after failing to win any of the first three state votes.</p><p>Biden hopes to gain ground in South Carolina, where he leads polls ahead of its primary on Saturday. But he and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have struggled to match Sanders in fundraising, making it harder for them to compete on a broader scale.</p><p>Bloomberg, a billionaire businessman, skipped the early states and has spent more than $500 million running ads in Super Tuesday states as he looks to surpass Biden and Buttigieg as the front-runner among moderates.</p><p>Bloomberg appears to be taking moderate voters from Biden in Texas, where both men are hoping to best Sanders.</p><p>The trio of states represented by candidates still in the running will also be closely watched.

That much was clear from the star','<p>T\nhe coronavirus crisis is a war against a disease, but it’s also the most serious battle yet in the war on truth. That much was clear from the start, as China moved to hush up the first outbreak and gag the doctor who had spotted it. It was a classic case of what we might call Chernobyl syndrome: the tendency of authoritarian systems to react to disaster by rushing to downplay or cover up the problem, focusing more on shifting blame than tackling the threat head on. Viewers of last year’s TV dramatisation of the Chernobyl nuclear accident could recognise the pattern immediately, as the priority of those in charge becomes avoiding embarrassment rather than saving lives.</p><p>There was some of that in the Iranian reaction to the virus, as the country’s deputy health minister coughed and sweated his way through a press conference called to reassure citizens, only later for it to be confirmed that he had himself been infected. (There were already suspicions, since Tehran’s official numbers didn’t add up.) And there was a grim logic to the fact that at the heart of the outbreak in South Korea is a religious sect similarly devoid of transparency.</p><p>Usually, the democratic world can contrast itself flatteringly with such closed, controlled societies, proud that its approach to calamity is openness and the free flow of information. Indeed, crises like this one can serve as test cases for the competing merits of free systems v authoritarian ones. True, democracies cannot match Beijing’s ability to lock down whole cities and build an entire hospital in a week. But when it comes to a global pandemic, it’s free speech, full disclosure and cross-border scientific cooperation that ultimately save lives.</p><p>Except this time, the familiar authoritarian v democratic contrast has become muddled. That’s because the current leader of the world’s most powerful democracy, the US, has the same instincts as the authoritarian rulers he so admires, and those instincts have coloured his response to coronavirus. The result is that what for many must have seemed an abstract concern – Donald Trump’s assault on facts, experts and science – is now a matter of life and death.</p><p>So while US medical officials have been at pains to brace Americans for the inevitability of coronavirus – a matter of when, not if – Trump and his outriders have worked hard to minimise the threat. On Thursday, Trump repeatedly referred to the figure of “15” cases in the US, when the actual figure was 60, and promised that that number would go down rather than up: “It’s going to disappear. One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”</p><p>Trump’s chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, breezily assured the US public that the bug had been contained and that the country was sealed “pretty close to airtight” against the disease, when of course it is not. One of the administration’s most influential propagandists – for whom Trump paused his state of the union address this month so that his wife, Melania, might garland him with America’s highest civilian honour, the Presidential Medal of Freedom – the talk radio host Rush Limbaugh has been telling his vast audience that “the coronavirus is the common cold, folks”, and that it had been “overhyped” and “weaponised … to bring down Donald Trump”.</p><p>Trump has nodded in a similarly conspiracist direction, tweeting that the media are doing all they can “to make the Caronavirus [sic] look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible”. That reference to the markets is key. Trump believes his chances of re-election in November hinge on his stewardship of the economy, betting that voters will back him if their pensions – linked to the stock market – are up. That the Dow Jones suffered the biggest one-day drop in its history on Thursday has him rattled.</p><p>And so his first instinct is that of the Manhattan hustler-hotelier loudly assuring guests that the strong smell of burning coming from the ground floor is merely the chef trying out a new barbecue rather than a sign that the building is on fire. Crucial to that effort is talking loudly over the fire marshals, or even gagging them altogether.</p><p>You could see that when Trump spoke in the White House briefing room, brazenly contradicting the experts by his side. But it’s now become formal policy, with Trump’s insistence that all federal officials – including those with deep scientific expertise – are to say nothing that has not first been authorised by the White House.</p><p>Note the fate of Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. On Thursday he dared say that “we are dealing with a serious virus” with a higher mortality rate than regular flu. That was deemed insufficiently upbeat for the great leader. According to the New York Times, “Dr Fauci has told associates that the White House had instructed him not to say anything else without clearance.”</p><p>The new mantra, it seems, is to be one of Trump’s favourite phrases: repeated again on Thursday: “Nobody really knows.” That could be the motto of post-truthists such as Trump, conveying the hope that voters will become confused, concluding that no truth is ever even possible, and that in the fog of information and rumour it’s best simply to trust the man in charge. That’s what Trump wants every American to believe, about coronavirus and everything else for that matter: nobody really knows.</p><p>Now Trump has put his slavishly deferential vice-president, Mike Pence, in charge of the coronavirus effort. Put aside Pence’s appalling record as governor of Indiana, when his response to an HIV outbreak was to veto a medically recommended needle exchange programme and to offer his prayers instead.</p><p>Focus instead on the fact that Pence has been appointed over the head of the health secretary, Alex Azar, whom Trump deemed too “alarmist”. In that same spirit, Trump has gutted the very agencies that the US will now desperately rely on. In 2018, he slashed health spending by $15bn, binning the Obama-era programmes and teams established for the express purpose of leading the US response to a pandemic. Among those cut: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – now in the frontline against coronavirus – which was forced to reduce by 80% its efforts to prevent global disease outbreak. The consequences are clear enough: only eight of the US’s 100 public-health labs are now even able to test for Covid-19.</p><p>This onslaught against the health agencies is of a piece with Trump’s entire approach to data, science and truth. You might remember “Sharpiegate”, when the president all but got out a black marker pen and amended a map issued by the key US meteorological agency so that it appeared to support his tweeted, and false, claim that Alabama was about to get hit by a hurricane. Trump has installed cronies and business pals at the helm of a raft of agencies previously respected as providers of neutral, factual data, the better to ensure those bodies say only what he wants them to say. He has moved to shrink their budgets – whether at the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps or the Census Bureau – and allowed experts with deep knowledge to retire and not be replaced.</p><p>We can’t say we weren’t warned. On Trump’s first full day in office, he telephoned the head of the National Park Service, angered by photographs showing that crowds that had gathered for his inauguration the previous day were smaller than those for Barack Obama. The head of the NPS duly passed on the instruction from the president, and new, more flattering images appeared.</p><p>We laughed about it at the time because it was so petty, so vain and so trivial. But the mindset was clear. The US president is a man who does not want the facts or the truth. He wants only what makes him look good. That impulse might not have mattered much in January 2017. But it matters gravely now.</p><p>• Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p><p>… we’re asking readers, like you, to make a new year contribution in support of the Guardian’s open, independent journalism.

The Syrian regime’s relentless assault upon Idlib, the last rebel-held area, is a humanitarian catastrophe. But it is Ankara’s announcement that it will no longer prevent Syrian refugees from travelling to Europe, alongside the growing risk of full-on military confrontation between Turkey and Damascus, potentially drawing in Moscow, which has grabbed international attention.</p><p>Turkish officials have threatened to reopen the migrant route across the Mediterranean, reversing an existing deal with the EU. The immediate impact is likely to be limited. It looks like a desperate bid to push the EU and Nato into supporting Turkey’s military operations in Idlib in defence of anti-regime militias, following the deaths of at least 33 of its soldiers on Thursday.</p><p>The primary casualties of the regime’s offensive, of course, are the Syrians trapped in the north-western province. To accuse Syria and its patron Russia of killing and maiming children through their indiscriminate and unrelenting assaults is too generous; not all the killing is indiscriminate. At least nine children died when 10 schools and nurseries came under attack on Wednesday, Unicef reported. Hospitals and other medical facilities have repeatedly been struck.</p><p>The Syrian government’s assault, aided too by Iran-backed fighters, has killed around 300 civilians since the start of the year and displaced a million people. Damascus says it is driving out terrorists, drawing no distinction between jihadist fighters, peaceful opponents and families caught up in the violence.</p><p>With 3.6 million Syrians already living in his country, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, wants to repatriate refugees to Idlib, not open the doors to the 3 million people now crowded there. Nor, having staked his credibility on intervention, does he want to lose face. Yet he is under domestic political pressure as Turkish deaths mount.</p><p>The prospects of European or US support – beyond rhetoric – appear low, unless perhaps he is willing to abandon the purchase of Russia’s S-400 air defence system. He has threatened to escalate unless Syrian forces withdraw to lines agreed in a 2018 ceasefire deal. But he appears to have been surprised by Vladimir Putin’s uncompromising stance. Russia is counting on the Turkish president’s need to protect his relationship with Mr Putin. While many believe Russian planes carried out Thursday’s precision strike, Moscow has denied responsibility – and Ankara has blamed Damascus.</p><p>The best-case scenario for Idlib may be that Turkey manages to preserve what is now left of the rebel-held area, leaving millions in these desperate conditions. Despite a ferocious counterattack on Syrian targets on Thursday, that looks unlikely while Russia controls the skies. The worst is that Syria and Russia triumph, forcing people into even greater misery.</p><p>Some seem to imagine that the crushing of Idlib, however brutal, will at least end the tragedy, bringing the return of refugees, the rehabilitation of the Assad regime and the reconstruction of the country after nine years of war. But Idlib holds the government’s most committed opponents, and jihadist fighters are already planning for an insurgency. An opposition once contained in the province will probably move undercover. And Syria will face a new phase of instability as well as further cruelty, with repercussions that will ultimately be felt beyond its borders.</p><p>… we’re asking readers, like you, to make a new year contribution in support of the Guardian’s open, independent journalism.

This being the Donald Trump administration, however, where qualifications and expertise are often seen as prohibitive factors for top jobs, that’s exactly who we’ve been given.</p><p>Cutting to the heart of the matter with her characteristic bluntness, Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez this week pointed out the absurdity of placing Pence in charge of a potentially looming health crisis.</p><p>“Mike Pence literally does not believe in science,” she tweeted on Wednesday. “It is utterly irresponsible to put him in charge of US coronavirus response as the world sits on the cusp of a pandemic. This decision could cost people their lives. Pence’s past decisions already have,” she said.</p><p>Ocasio-Cortez reminded people of Pence’s credentials for the job. While he was governor of Indiana, he oversaw an HIV crisis that was so severe that at its peak, 20 new cases of HIV were diagnosed every week.</p><p>“As governor, Pence’s science denial contributed to one of the worst HIV outbreaks in Indiana’s history,” she continued. “He is not a medical doctor. He is not a health expert. He is not qualified nor positioned in any way to protect our public health.”</p><p>Rushing to the defense of the administration the next day, Ted Cruz jumped into the fray.</p><p>As you are speaking as the oracle of science, tell us, what exactly is a Y chromosome? https://t.co/t4XVVzWr3A</p><p>“As you are speaking as the oracle of science, tell us, what exactly is a Y chromosome?” Cruz responded on Twitter. “And at what age of gestation does science tell us that an unborn child feels physical pain?”</p><p>He may have picked the wrong opponent – Ocasio-Cortez, it transpires, holds an award for microbiology from MIT.</p><p>Despite reports in the past of the two lawmakers, surprisingly, finding common ground on other issues, Ocasio-Cortez did not let the slight go unaddressed this morning. Touting her scientific background bona fides, and jabbing at Cruz, who, like Pence, gives primacy to his religious beliefs over science, she delivered an acerbic put-down.</p><p>“I’m surprised you’re asking about chromosomes given that you don’t believe in evolution,” she said.</p><p>Sen. Cruz, while I understand you judge people’s intelligence by the lowest income they’ve had, I hold awards from MIT Lincoln Lab &others for accomplishments in microbiology.\n\nSecondly, I’m surprised you’re asking about chromosomes given that you don’t even believe in evolution. https://t.co/vOIwJhpl7q</p><p>Cruz stopped responding after that.</p><p>... we have a small favour to ask.

End of Fashion, Mojo Juju and the Jam Tarts will be playing at stages set up in along the way.</p><p>“We’ve had bands ringing us from the Canary Islands to Japan to California, you name it, prepared to fly themselves here to be a part of it. AC/DC’s reach is actually phenomenal; they discovered this formula early on and they just stayed true to it. I think there’s something about that that resonates with people, it’s like a constant known in your life.”</p><p>Bon Scott occupies a unique place in the popular culture psyche, betwixt and beyond that of even AC/DC’s global fame; the pub laureate – the lascivious, loquacious ratbag with a sensitive side – seems to speak to the battler in all of us. The event will run along a stretch of highway between the Fremantle home of his youth and the watering hole he frequented: the Raffles hotel. The event marks 40 years – to the day – since Bon Scott’s ashes were buried at Fremantle Cemetery; Metallica, Soundgarden and the Cult are among the luminaries who have visited the grave since.</p><p>The event is a logistical feat which will close not just the long stretch of a major city artery – two lanes for the trucks, the other two for the public – but the 120 side streets leading into it. While some may see it as a Bogan Barbecue, it would seem more fitting to call it a Fanfare For the Common Man.</p><p>The concept was hatched in late 2018 by newly minted artistic director Iain Grandage. Consultations involved three councils – Melville, Fremantle and East Fremantle – plus the state government and its relevant departments, Main Roads, Perth Transit Authority and the Western Australian Police. According to Stone, it was never a case of “why do it?” but “how it could be done”.</p><p>Stone says all concerned parties have “bent over backwards” amid the many approvals required to get this event – moving trucks and all – rolling down the road.</p><p>“If people think that local government has a reputation for not being flexible or quick to respond then this experience certainly shatters that view,” he notes. “They’ve all managed to see the big picture very clearly.”</p><p>“The Bon Scott story is a local story,” Stone adds. “It’s a Western Australian story which is a beautiful thing and a good connection with the community. The other thing is the reclamation of the highway for the day – there’s a whole lot of layers to it and that resonates as strongly with people as any element of the event.”</p><p>There is a wildness around the event that reflects the man himself. “There’s a risk around it but that’s exciting,” he says – an ethos that extends to the covers themselves. “It’s not about replicating what [AC/DC] have done; it’s about taking it to a new space, having fun with the whole Bon Scott masculinity myth and taking AC/DC tunes into a new realm.”</p><p>All-female group Jam Tarts, who will be playing at Tompkins Park, are thrilled to take part: “Bon Scott is pure, undilated 100% rock’n’roll,” says singer turned latter-day celebrity chef Anna Gare.</p><p>Southern River Band are one of the truck-bound musicians who will be playing. “Bon Scott is freedom, an outlaw holding a microphone in place of a gun, in a world none too welcoming,” frontman Callum Kramer says. “If there’s gonna be something to shut half the highway down for, I can’t think of anything better than AC/DC.”</p><p>End Of Fashion’s Justin Burford feels the same way. “Bon Scott is as Aussie as meat pies and as West Aussie as bad merging. We’re proud to be a part of any event that has the potential for wreaking havoc and chaos on this scale, and I bet Bon is pissing himself laughing at the whole thing from wherever he is now.”</p><p>• Highway To Hell closes down Perth’s Canning Highway on Sunday 1 March from 3pm.

Although the US has previously said it would only supply similar equipment directly if Turkey ditches plans to deploy a rival Russian S-400 system.</p><p>Nato had held urgent talks on the crisis on Friday after Turkey requested a rare emergency meeting of members under article 4 of the alliance’s governing treaty, on the grounds that its security was under threat.</p><p>Turkish officials blamed Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian regime for the major attack on its troops and launched retaliatory attacks, saying it had destroyed five Syrian military helicopters and two air defence systems, and “neutralised” 309 Syrian regime soldiers, without providing evidence. A war monitor said at least 20 Syrian troops had died in the counterattacks.</p><p>However, several sources in Idlib and unverified footage of the night-time strike suggested it had been carried out by the Russian air force, which has helped Damascus conduct a ferocious three-month offensive in the province.</p><p>President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s communications director, Fahrettin Altun, said Turkey had retaliated by hitting Damascus regime targets “from the air and ground”. Drone footage released by the Turkish military of the response showed blistering attacks on tanks, howitzers and soldiers.</p><p>US secretary of state Mike Pompeo described Thursday’s attack as “despicable and brazen” and said the US was “reviewing options to assist Turkey against this aggression as we seek to prevent further Assad regime and Russian brutality and alleviate the humanitarian suffering in Idlib.”</p><p>One Turkish soldier was killed and another wounded in a fresh artillery fire by the Syrian regime on Friday.</p><p>Dominic Raab, the UK’s foreign secretary, led calls to hold an emergency UN security council session in New York on Friday evening, supported by the US, France, Germany, Estonia, the Dominican Republic and Belgium, which holds the security council presidency.</p><p>Raab said: “Yesterday’s events only confirmed the reckless and brutal nature of the offensive which the Syrian regime and Russia are conducting in Idlib. This has created the gravest humanitarian crisis of the entire war.”</p><p>No formal resolution is expected following the meeting, but diplomats said the key discussion points would be the attribution of the strike and whether any security council member would say it was carried out by a Russian plane.</p><p>Turkey said Erdoğan had discussed the crisis with the US president, Donald Trump, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Friday. The chancellor’s spokesman said she “condemned the ruthless attacks on Turkish troops”.</p><p>Almost a million people have been displaced and driven north to the Turkish border by the regime campaign on rebels and jihadist factions, making the battle for control of Syria’s last opposition stronghold the worst humanitarian crisis in the war to date.</p><p>The deadly bombardment has added to weeks of growing tensions between Turkey, a supporter of Syrian rebels and a Nato member, and Moscow, which is allied with Assad.</p><p>Adding to the volatile situation, Moscow sent two warships, the Admiral Makarov and Admiral Grigorovich, both capable of firing Kalibr cruise missiles, from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean waters off Syria on Friday. They moved through the Bosphorus strait, which is governed by an international treaty, sailing through the heart of Istanbul.</p><p>In a telephone call with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, Erdoğan said Syrian government troops and allied forces remained legitimate targets for Ankara. The Kremlin said it agreed on the need for a new arrangement to avert clashes in Idlib. Turkey said the leaders agreed to meet as soon as possible.</p><p>There was no immediate confirmation from Damascus of the reported troop deaths or any comment on the flare-up with Ankara.</p><p>The UN said the latest fighting was coming “dangerously close” to encampments of the displaced, risking an imminent “bloodbath”.</p><p>Turkey, which is already home to millions of Syrian refugees, fears more people will attempt to cross its closed southern border as the Assad regime tries to recapture Idlib, the last significant rebel-held province in the north-west of the country, with the help of Russian airstrikes.</p><p>Thursday’s attack brought to 53 the number of Turkish security personnel killed in Idlib this month. Elsewhere on Thursday, jihadists and Turkish-backed rebels re-entered Saraqeb, a key Idlib crossroads town they had lost earlier in February, reversing one of the main gains of the government’s devastating offensive.</p><p>The counter-offensive could, however, be short-lived as Russian-backed Syrian troops continued to chip away at other parts of the rebel bastion, capturing 20 localities.</p><p>Seven civilians, including three children, were killed in regime and Russian bombardment of Idlib, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, adding to more than 400 such deaths since December.</p><p>… we’re asking readers, like you, to make a new year contribution in support of the Guardian’s open, independent journalism.

And this is only possible because we made a different choice: to keep our reporting open for all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford to pay.</p><p>We have upheld our editorial independence in the face of the disintegration of traditional media – with social platforms giving rise to misinformation, the seemingly unstoppable rise of big tech and independent voices being squashed by commercial ownership.

It means we can challenge the powerful without fear and give a voice to those less heard.</p><p>None of this would have been attainable without our readers’ generosity – your financial support has meant we can keep investigating, disentangling and interrogating.

Or indeed, that he isn’t fighting every Saturday and midweek too, p','<p>I\nt is hugely disappointing that Tyson Fury isn’t fighting again this weekend. Or indeed, that he isn’t fighting every Saturday and midweek too, part of a 68-game Tyson Fury fixture pileup, bookended in summer with four weeks of Tyson Fury tournament competition.</p><p>It is still worth saying. How good was that fight? How good was the buildup? How good was it watching Fury sit behind a table saying stuff, looking like some ancient mulch-stinking ogre, driven out of his cave, hosed down, crammed into a tracksuit and asked to offer his thoughts on belts and rematches, on maypoles, solstice and the vengeful ways of the earth goddess.</p><p>The answer is very good indeed. Not to mention strangely affecting. Big title fights have always had a well of mainstream interest to draw on. But there is something remarkable about the spread and the depth of Fury’s popularity.</p><p>This isn’t about belts. It isn’t really about sport. People love Fury. Write something sympathetic about him and you get letters, confessionals, stories of consolation and personal struggle. This doesn’t happen with any other sports person. It always happens with Fury. Why?</p><p>It doesn’t make sense in pure sports marketing terms. What are we selling here? Fury might look like a wild man, but he is in fact something more esoteric and difficult. His chief skill is a mastery of angles and combinations, arms coiled like forklift truck pistons, slippery bald head bobbing, feet flapping with a weird nimble grace.</p><p>It’s not about the delivery system either. To watch Fury in action you have to pay £25, stay up until 4am and gamble on the fact one bad fight kills the whole thing for six months either side.</p><p>Plus, as part of his wider personal marketing scheme Fury has said all the wrong things, expressing opinions about women and gay people so hostile they’re likely to offend even people already predisposed not to like women or gay people.</p><p>He’s been booed in public. He’s been “cancelled” on the internet (who comes back from a cancelling?) and petitioned by almost 100,000 people not to attend the BBC sport personality jamboree. And yet he is right now the most popular English sports person.</p><p>This is no small thing for boxing, which has been assumed at various points to be in terminal decline. I love boxing as a spectacle and a discipline. But let’s be honest, it wouldn’t exist in its current form if we were to start again now from scratch.</p><p>In other sports we worry about concussion protocols, about restricting the heading of a football on medical advice. In boxing the entire show revolves around asking the best people in the world at battering you in the head to batter you in the head as hard as they can.</p><p>Not that this is illogical in itself. Humans like violence: look around. But boxing has taken this somewhere else right now, has plastered itself right across the main stage. Fury the man, Fury the person is central to this. The deep, soulful craft of Tyson Fury. The redemptive sculptural violence of Tyson Fury. People crave this. It is probably worth asking why.</p><p>The most obvious thing to ask about Fury Love is: is it really OK? Does it come from a weird place? Is it a bit, you know, “Incel”? A bit male power? Looking at the fervour of his support some part of me wonders if Fury is acting as a kind of Muhammad Ali figure for angry white bald men.</p><p>This isn’t an easy thing to say, because he is separately a hugely inspiring figure, a source of comfort and strength for those who have also struggled with problems in their lives.</p><p>Fury has come back from a place people don’t come back from. We know about that cycle of pain and vilification. Fury tried to drink himself to death. For years he seemed stuck in a moment, overwhelmed by his own defeat of Wladimir Klitschko, a fight he’d been planning since he was 14 years old. He still struggles. He tells other people it’s OK to struggle.</p><p>Still, though. We as a society don’t usually forgive like this, let alone cherish and adore those who have previously offended. Fury has said he would hang his own sister if she was promiscuous. The evangelist creed he espouses equates homosexuality with paedophilia. He has said “a woman’s place is in the kitchen and on her back”, which, even treated on its own dubious merits, definitely isn’t the best position to prepare any kind of snack or light meal.</p><p>You can be pretty sure Fury hasn’t changed his mind about any of this. And yet here he is all the same, the most obviously loved, oddly hopeful figure in British sport.</p><p>Perhaps the point here is that Fury comes from a place so leftfield it forces you to understand and engage with him. So much of modern life is spent shouting pointlessly at those with whom we disagree, or whose views threaten us. What do we want them to do, really? Where do we want the angry disagreeable people to go? To die or vanish, or become re-educated by the force of our disapproval? How do we reconcile this and make it stop?</p><p>At which point, enter Fury, the ultimate deep, damp toxic male; and yet also somehow an advocate of gentleness and understanding, someone who still feels like he’s your friend.</p><p>Like boxing itself, he comes from the margins, from a place where people really do say and think things we might not like or agree with. Fury has suffered. Fury gave up on life. And yet, here he is, still alive. Not like me, or you perhaps, but still somehow strangely redemptive – and far from finished yet.</p>','Unknown','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/28/people-crave-the-redemptive-violence-of-tyson-fury-its-worth-asking-why',8,1,'2020-02-29 20:04:13','2020-02-29 20:04:13',2),(1429603,'garth-brooks-confuses-fans-with-sanders-jersey-----i-wish-you---d-keep-your-political-preferences-to-yourself---','Garth Brooks confuses fans with Sanders jersey: ‘I wish you’d keep your political preferences to yourself’','Many took Brooks’s garment to be a reference to Bernie Sanders','Garth Brooks caused confusion among his fans by wearing a Sanders jersey during a recent gig.The country singer shared a photo of himself on social me','<p>Garth Brooks caused confusion among his fans by wearing a Sanders jersey during a recent gig.</p><p>The country singer shared a photo of himself on social media to mark a performance in Detroit, Michigan. In the photo, he wears a number 20 jersey with the name “Sanders” on it.</p><p>Many took it to be a reference to Bernie Sanders, the 2020 presidential hopeful, but it appears the jersey was actually meant as a reference to Barry Sanders, a former NFL player with the Detroit Lions.</p><p>According to MLive.com, the crowd at Brooks’s concert got the reference and at one point chanted: “Barry! Barry! Barry!”</p><p>“I’ll tell you why I’m wearing the jersey I am wearing tonight,” Brooks said. “I was lucky enough to be an athlete and to wear the same uniform as this guy wore in college. I was lucky to go to school with him. You guys got the greatest player in NFL history in my opinion in this jersey. I love this man.”</p><p>For those who weren’t at the concert, however, the reference wasn’t as clear – and many have criticised Brooks’s jersey on social media, asking him to refrain from making political statements.</p><p>“I wish you would’ve kept your political preferences to yourself.

And major outbreaks of Covid-19 outside China were always a serious risk, as anyone who listened to the briefings of disease modellers and virologists knew.</p><p>And the shutdown of vast swathes of the Chinese economy – the world’s second largest economy and dominant driver of global growth – in itself should have surely prompted at least some downward adjustment of companies’ share prices.</p><p>As it was, American share indexes carried on hitting new peaks, even as the concerning news from on the ground in China, Korea and elsewhere kept flowing in.</p><p>It’s hard to disagree with Nouriel “Dr Doom” Roubini that markets were guilty of complacency, if not myopia. This hasn’t been a great advert for the theory that markets are “efficient”.</p><p>But what about the unravelling “happening faster than you thought they could”, the second part of Dornbusch’s observation? That’s less obvious. The scale of the sell-off of shares this week has certainly been big.</p><p>Globally shares are on track for their worst week since the financial crisis. Around $6 trillion in market value has been lost over the past eight days according to calculations by Bloomberg.</p><p>Yet this is not – as of yet – out of line with previous stock market corrections.</p><p>Thursday’s Dow Jones Index’s fall, measured in points, was the largest in its history. That’s somewhat misleading though. As an index’s overall value gets larger over the decades any day’s average losses in points will likely be larger than those in the past. In percentage terms the 4.4 per cent decline on Thursday did not even make the top 100 daily drops for the venerable American share index.</p><p>And remember that the value of the Dow soared by 60 per cent between February 2016 and the first half of this month. Global stock markets are estimated to have increased in value by $17 trillion in 2019 alone.</p><p>But, of course, the key question is how much worse things will get? Are we still near the top of the rollercoaster’s dip, with the real plunge yet to come?</p><p>And this is where it’s folly to predict with any degree of confidence. While it’s reasonable to criticise traders for being blind for too long to the risks of Covid-19 inflicting damage on the global economy, we should beware assuming, as a baseline scenario, that it will inflict massive damage, or cause the global recession that some analysts are now talking about.</p><p>We simply don’t know. The progress of the health crisis will be driven by the progress of the virus. To some extent that’s out of human hands, depending on the biology of this pathogen.</p><p>But good public health policies – government-to-government information sharing, quarantines, isolation – can impede it and hopefully contain it.</p><p>The extent of the economic damage of this outbreak will depend in large part on that health containment effort.</p><p>But it will also depend on containing panic among the public, and that includes panic in financial markets.

At least 91 Jews – and probably many more – were killed by Nazi supporters egged on by Joseph Goebbels, the minister for public enlightenment and propaganda, in what became known as Kristallnacht – “the Night of Broken Glass”. It was a decisive staging post on the road to mass genocide.</p><p>On 23 February 2020 in Delhi, Hindu nationalist mobs roamed the streets burning and looting mosques together with Muslim homes, shops and businesses. They killed or burned alive Muslims who could not escape and the victims were largely unprotected by the police. At least 37 people, almost all Muslims, were killed and many others beaten half to death: a two-year-old baby was stripped by a gang to see if he was circumcised – as Muslims usually are, but Hindus are not. Some Muslim women pretended to be Hindus in order to escape.</p><p>Government complicity was not as direct as in Germany 82 years earlier, but activists of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, were reported as being in the forefront of the attacks on Muslims. A video was published showing Muslim men, covered in blood from beatings, being forced to lie on the ground by police officers and compelled to sing patriotic songs. Modi said nothing for several days and then made a vague appeal for “peace and brotherhood”.</p><p>The government’s real attitude towards the violence was shown when it instantly transferred a judge critical of its actions during the riots. Judge Muralidhar of the Delhi High Court was hearing petitions about the violence when he said that the court could not allow “another 1984” to happen, referring to the killing of 3,000 Sikhs by mobs in Delhi in that year after the assassination of former prime minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards. He said the government should provide shelter for those who had been forced to flee and questioned if the police were properly recording victims’ complaints.</p><p>The government says that Judge Muralidhar’s transfer had already been announced and claims that its speedy implementation of the move had nothing to do with his remarks.</p><p>Accusations of fascist behaviour by present day political leaders and their governments, similar to that of fascist regimes in Germany, Italy and Spain in the 1930s and 1940s, should not be made lightly. Such comparisons have been frequently levelled in recent years against nationalist, authoritarian populists from the US and the Philippines to Poland to Brazil. Often the allegation is believed by the accuser and, at other times, it is simply a term of abuse. Yet Modi and the BJP appear closer than other right-wing regimes to traditional fascism in their extreme nationalism and readiness to use violence. At the centre of their agenda is their brand of Hindu nationalism and a relentless bid to marginalise or evict India’s 200 million Muslims.</p><p>The rest of the world has been slow to grasp the gravity of what is happening in India because the Modi government has played down its project to shift India away from its previous status as a pluralistic secular state. The sheer number of people negatively affected by this change is gigantic: if the Muslim minority in India was a separate country then it would be eighth largest state in the world by population.</p><p>The violence in Delhi this week stems from the fear and hatred generated by the government-directed pincer movement against Muslims in India. One pincer is in the shape of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), under which non-Muslim migrants can swiftly gain Indian citizenship but Muslims cannot. Even more threatening is the National Register of Citizens (NRC), which is likely to deprive many Indian Muslims of their citizenship. It was the non-violent protests and demonstrations opposing these measures that provoked the Hindu nationalist mobs into staging what was close to a pogrom earlier this week.</p><p>Just how far Modi and the BJP will go in their anti-Muslim campaign is already in evidence in Jammu and Kashmir, the one Indian state with a Muslim majority. It was summarily stripped of its autonomy last August and has been locked down ever since. Mass detentions and torture are the norm according to the few witnesses able to report what they have seen.</p><p>For 150 days after the government revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status, the internet was cut off and it has only been restored to a very limited degree since January. The security forces detain who they want and distraught family members complain that they cannot find their relatives or that they are too poor to visit them in prisons that may be 800 miles away.</p><p>The isolation of Kashmir has largely worked from the government point of view in sealing it off from the outside world. But would it make much difference if events there were better known? The burnings and killings in Delhi this week are well publicised, but regarded with a certain tolerance internationally: Modi can trade off India’s reputation as a ramshackle democracy and a feeling that “communal violence” is traditional in India, like hurricanes in Florida or earthquakes in Japan, and nobody is really to blame.</p><p>There has been an encouraging, though fiercely repressed, wave of opposition in India to the degradation of its non-sectarian traditions. The danger here – and the mobs in Delhi may be a sign of this – is that Modi and his government will respond to these protests by playing the Hindu nationalist card even more strongly.</p><p>Dealing with foreign criticism, the government may say that, regardless of its domestic political programme, it is supercharging economic growth and this excuses its other failings. Authoritarian regimes, with control over most of their own media, often make such claims and, when economic statistics show the opposite, they simply fake a new set of figures. A recent study of the Indian economy noted that, while overall economic growth had supposedly risen strongly, the growth in investment, profits, tax revenues, imports, exports, industrial output and credit had all weakened in recent years.</p><p>In one respect, Modi is in a stronger position than Germany after Kristallnacht. President Roosevelt responded with a statement denouncing antisemitism and violence in Germany and promptly withdrew the US ambassador. President Trump, on a two-day visit to India at a time that Muslims were being hunted down and killed a few miles from where he was sitting, said he was satisfied that Modi was working “really hard” to establish religious freedom.</p>','Patrick Cockburn','https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/delhi-riots-news-narendra-modi-muslims-hindus-jammu-kashmir-trump-a9365376.html',12,1,'2020-02-29 20:04:13','2020-02-29 20:04:13',2),(1429608,'google-employee-who-was-at-zurich-office-tests-positive-for-coronavirus','Google employee who was at Zurich office tests positive for coronavirus','','(Reuters) - An employee of Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, who had been in the Zurich office, has tested positive for coronavirus, the company said','<p>(Reuters) - An employee of Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, who had been in the Zurich office, has tested positive for coronavirus, the company said on Friday.</p><p>“The Zurich office, like all other offices, remains open”, a Google spokesperson said.</p><p>The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Switzerland has risen to 15, and more than 100 people are in quarantine, government minister Alain Berset said.</p><p>Google is further restricting its employee travel as concerns around the outbreak grow, Business Insider reported earlier in the day, citing a source familiar with the matter.

The worst crisis with Russia since a fighter jet was shot down in 2015.</p><p>Thursday night, when the news first broke that 33 Turkish soldiers been killed in an air strike blamed on Syrian regime forces, was the point when multiple strands began to unravel from the Turkish government’s unwieldy Syria policy.</p><p>But make no mistake: President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was pulling every lever at his disposal on Friday to make sure the world paid attention.</p><p>In the 12 hours since news of the air strike broke, the Turkish government has accused Russia of allowing the attack to happen, restricted public access to social media, called an emergency Nato meeting to discuss the crisis – and allowed millions of refugees living in the country to believe they will now be waved through to Europe.</p><p>Hulusi Akar, the defence minister, said the Turkish military had also retaliated against over 200 positions occupied by Syrian regime forces, destroying tanks, helicopters and air defence systems.</p><p>It’s had the effect of throwing dozens of bargaining chips onto the table at once.</p><p>The fact is that the Turkish government’s position on Syria’s hideous civil war has changed little since the early days of the conflict: it still believes Bashar al-Assad should go, Islamist groups should be armed to fight him, and the region’s Kurds should never have more autonomy.</p><p>When the balance of war changed, such as when Britain refused to militarily intervene in 2013 or Vladimir Putin pushed Russia into the conflict in 2015, Turkey did not shift those basic objectives — only the countries it worked with to achieve them.</p><p>Managing the conflict in Syria with Russia was a major reason why Turkey chose to buy the expensive S-400 missile defence system, despite Western warnings that it would not work with Nato defences and be a conflict of interest to buy weapons from the alliance’s main adversary.</p><p>But Mr Erdogan’s supporters could argue, at least at first, that the arrangement was working - the president has joined Iran and Russia’s leaders at multiple summits in recent years to discuss and agree deals on Syria’s future. It was, they said, a remarkable turnaround in relations from when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet and a war seemed imminent.</p><p>And yet last October’s invasion of a Kurdish-dominated area of northern Syria served mostly to push the Kurds closer to Assad’s side, while regime attacks on Idlib, the main remaining opposition-held province, grow fiercer by the day.</p><p>Only the best news in your inbox</p><p>Register with your social account or click here to log in</p><p>Mr Erdogan believed that, by coordinating troop movements through Moscow, an incident like Thursday night’s could be avoided.</p><p>In response, Turkey swiftly switched focus to the West. </p><p>No official ministerial announcement was issued, but suddenly every refugee in the country was led to believe they would no longer be stopped by Turkish border guards if they attempted to cross into Europe.</p><p>\"All refugees, including Syrians, are now welcome to cross into the European Union,” an official had told Reuters.</p><p>Within hours, Turkish television was showing live pictures of families trudging across fields or loading into dinghies in an attempt to make it to Europe. Buses were even laid on from cities like Istanbul to get them to the border.</p><p>It’s a reversal of the deal struck with the EU to stop refugees in 2016, when Turkey agreed to take back those that made it across in exchange for billions of euros in funding.</p><p>Mr Erdogan, well aware of the political impact that year’s migrant crisis had on European countries, has often threatened to revoke the deal. He did so today, hours after his arrangement with Russia appeared to crumble.</p><p>It is not yet clear whether this westward shift will be temporary, or deliver the support the Turkish government seeks in Syria.</p><p>But Thursday night’s vast death toll has generated anger among the Turkish public, many of whom are asking why their country is still fighting in Syria. As opposition parties call for direct negotiations with the Assad regime and proposals to return refugees to Syria finding wider support, Mr Erdogan is finding he has few chips left to play.</p>','Michael Daventry','https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/syria-news-turkey-russia-tensions-erdogan-civil-war-a9365771.html',12,1,'2020-02-29 20:04:13','2020-02-29 20:04:13',2),(1429618,'asia-bibi--pakistani-woman-jailed-for-blasphemy-claims-asylum-in-france','Asia Bibi: Pakistani woman jailed for blasphemy claims asylum in France','','Asia Bibi, the Pakistani Christian woman who spent eight years on death row on blasphemy charges, has filed an initial application for asylum in Franc','<p>Asia Bibi, the Pakistani Christian woman who spent eight years on death row on blasphemy charges, has filed an initial application for asylum in France and been invited to live in the country by Emmanuel Macron.</p><p>But speaking after a meeting with the French president in the Elysée palace on Friday, Bibi said she had not decided where she would settle. She was acquitted last year and granted a one-year leave of stay with her family in Canada.</p><p>“I need time to think,” Bibi said. “Canada has been good to me. France has been very good to me – and France has given me a name. But for the time being I need to concentrate on my health, my family and my children’s education.”</p><p>Bibi’s case outraged Christians around the world and fanned divisions inside mainly Muslim Pakistan. The former farm worker was sentenced to death in 2010 after Muslim labourers working with her in the fields refused to share their water because she was Christian.</p><p>An argument broke out and one woman went to a local cleric to accuse Bibi of committing blasphemy against the prophet Muhammad. Two Pakistani politicians were later killed for publicly supporting her and criticising the country’s draconian blasphemy laws.</p><p>Pakistan’s supreme court overturned the conviction in October 2018, sparking violent protests in the country and calls for the judges in the case to be killed. The violence was led by the Islamic group Tehreek-e-Labbaik.</p><p>Bibi was also in France to promote her book Enfin Libre! (Finally Free!), co-written with Anne-Isabelle Tollet, a French journalist who helped publicise her case with two previous books and forming an international support committee in 2015.</p><p>“I was very honoured to be received by the president, to be next to him, and to be invited to live here,” Bibi said, sitting alongside her daughter Eisha, 21, who is disabled. She was also accompanied on the trip by her husband Ashiq, 58, and her second daughter Eisham, 20.</p><p>“France is a symbol for me,” she said. “It was the first country in the world to really support me, and the country from which my name became known.” Bibi said she was also deeply honoured earlier this week to meet the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, who presented her with honorary citizenship of the city.</p><p>An Elysée official said France was “ready to welcome” Bibi if she wished, providing she met the criteria for asylum. French rules require asylum seekers to submit a request to an independent state agency, Ofpra, which decides whether it should be to granted.</p><p>It is understood that Bibi filled in the appropriate forms with her family members on Friday. Although she said she had not received any recent death threats, Islamic extremists have pledged to pursue and kill her.</p><p>In Canada, she lives with her husband and daughters in a three-bedroom apartment in an undisclosed location. She told French media this week she was hopeful things would change to allow her and her family to return to Pakistan one day.</p><p>“I really hope for it, just the way I kept hope when I was in jail that one day I was going to be free,” she said. Bibi said she was grateful for the prayers of fellow Christians around the world who had helped her remain strong before her release.</p><p>In her book, Bibi recounts how she was kept chained in prison and jeered at by other detainees. A devout Catholic, she said she had never committed blasphemy: “I cannot even think of insulting any prophet. I didn’t say anything. It was all about a glass of water.”</p>','Jon Henley in Paris','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/asia-bibi-pakistani-woman-jailed-for-blasphemy-claims-asylum-in-france',8,1,'2020-02-29 20:04:13','2020-02-29 20:04:13',2),(1429619,'sea-lion-found-wandering-along-forest-road----a-significant-distance----from-any-water','Sea lion found wandering along forest road ‘a significant distance’ from any water','Animal is now back in its normal habitat ','A lone 600-pound sea lion was found wandering along a forest path far from any water, before being captured and successfully relocated to a river.

Lest any ambiguity remain, Peter Dutton went on to utter “plan” another 16 times if you happened to be counting, and our indefatigable live blogger, Amy Remeikis, bless her, was counting.</p><p>Plans revealed themselves in the preambles to questions, and in the answers to questions; a thicket of plans for potential pandemics, for managing the economy, a plan for beating up Labor over its increasingly uncontroversial commitment to net zero emissions by 2050. Or perhaps that one was a strategy.</p><p>The urgency and intensity of the messaging was such that I wondered whether we might at any moment see live broadcasts interrupted with a solemn message to the nation at the top of the hour: “Fellow Australians, this is your government speaking. Did we mention we have a plan? Did we mention we have a plan for a plan?”</p><p>Before I get branded a shocking cynic, let’s be clear. It is obvious the government needs to have a considered and credible plan for managing a mass outbreak of the coronavirus, because the spread of this illness, and the negative economic consequences associated with it, is a deeply serious issue, not some passing bit of political confection or rank opportunism.</p><p>The world is watching unfolding events in a state of shared nervousness. Leaders are warning an epidemic is on the way and the trajectory of infections prompted a record plunge in the US stock market on Friday as analysts warned the outbreak could wreak economic havoc on a scale not seen since the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p>In short, this is all profoundly serious, and it is not a drill. So I’m relieved Australia has a plan, because we do need one, and it would great if the government can both develop and execute it competently.</p><p>Having acknowledged there is a serious challenge to manage and the country absolutely needs a plan to manage it, let’s drill down a bit further. It’s pretty obvious why the government is intent on telling voters there is a plan for managing coronavirus and other potential crises.</p><p>To put it bluntly, Morrison’s theatre of The Plan® is atonement for the disaster of the summer.</p><p>If we take a minute or two to recap the sorry story of the bushfires, the only thing the government mastered was looking like a shambles. As the fire emergency spiralled, Morrison presented during a time of terrible crisis as a leader making it up as he went along. In the court of public opinion, the government was constantly running behind events. Haplessness could be measured in increments, from the ill-fated Hawaii holiday through to calling out the defence forces without telling the poor bloke managing the bulk of the blazes.</p><p>As well as conveying a compelling impression of a government extemporising inelegantly in full public view, Morrison looked resentful when obvious deficiencies and inconsistencies were pointed out to him. Presenting to the public with pursed lips and barely restrained pique, not every time, but often enough to be memorable, I reckon compounded negative voter perceptions and made the inevitable backlash worse.</p><p>Our Guardian Essential poll in mid-January delivered a stark snapshot of the credibility hit. Morrison’s net approval rating shifted from plus two to negative 12, and the Labor leader Anthony Albanese sprinted ahead of Morrison as preferred prime minister (despite the fact the poll shows consistently voters are still getting a fix on the Labor leader).</p><p>Because everything is so polarised, because politics has substituted conflict (easy) for reform (hard), because technology is herding people into tribes, and because default mainstream media culture tells people these days it is OK, in fact, desirable, to sit in an enclave that confirms your biases, preferably with noise-cancelling headphones – Morrison didn’t take too much of a hit among rusted-on Coalition voters. They, largely, stuck.</p><p>But if our poll snapshot is accurate, across Labor and (critically) undecided voters, one in seven people changed their minds about Morrison between December and January. The prime minister also took a significant hit on the attributes questions we ask the Guardian Essential sample regularly about leaders. There was a nine-point drop in the number of voters rating Morrison a capable leader. Worse, there was a 19-point drop in the number of voters saying he was good in a crisis.</p><p>Now I want to consider these specific attributes a little.</p><p>Given the Coalition’s defining pitch to Australian voters is always we will keep you safe and secure, because we are conservatives, and that’s what conservatives do (in contrast to wild-eyed progressives, who favour social change over security) – a loss of public confidence in attributes like “capable”, and “good in a crisis” is potentially dangerous for Morrison and the government.</p><p>The language of safety, security and managerial competence is the most powerful language Australian conservatives have in their toolkit. That language is resonant enough to win elections.</p><p>Security is such a critical part of the pitch that the disastrous summer Morrison just presided over actually begs an existential question for a Liberal prime minister who likes to style himself as the Generation X John Howard.</p><p>It’s a simple question.</p><p>What good is a conservative who can’t keep Australians safe?</p><p>One more brief observation before we wrap up. Looking ahead, I reckon climate change poses a significant dilemma for the Coalition.</p><p>Since the Abbott era, the Coalition has been able to weaponise climate change to its political advantage. But weaponising climate change is a whole lot easier when global heating is an abstract risk, or in the minds of some, an entirely hypothetical possibility. I think that becomes harder to navigate when heating is a lived reality – when people are dealing with the practical consequences of natural disasters, like the summer we’ve just experienced. But as they say in the classics, only time will tell.</p><p>More immediately, Morrison’s challenge is to stabilise and turn public perceptions. This is a critical mission. The prime minister, a former campaign director, respects research and data, so he will know that recent political history suggests voters make up their minds about prime ministers and governments pretty early in a term.</p><p>Those perceptions, once formed, are hard to budge. I reckon Julia Gillard, Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull could all share a story or two about the increasingly transient nature of political honeymoons in Australia.</p><p>So, in summary, The Plan® you keep hearing about carries a lot of freight. There are actual, practical plans to manage risks, and there are political projections of risk management. For the government, both will feel important. Implicitly Morrison wants to tell you he is learning on the job.</p><p>The past week in politics tells us this. The prime minister and the government need a way to apologise for the summer and reboot, without admitting any liability, because introspection and contrition is really not a hallmark of this government, at least not in public.</p><p>If contrition is impossible, because sorry is such a hard word to say, then perhaps competence, assuming that materialises, can serve as a substitute.</p><p>... we have a small favour to ask.

That’s why all eyes were on Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar during a Congressional hearing this week when he inexplicably said that he could not promise a vaccine for the coronavirus would be affordable. He even went on to say that “we can’t control the price because we need the private sector to invest.</p><p>While he soon walked back his comment after receiving blistering criticism, Secretary Azar unwittingly revealed a long standing socio-economic injustice in the way drugs and vaccines are made in America. It becomes all the more glaring as we sit on the verge of a possible coronavirus pandemic. </p><p>American taxpayers fund the research and development of many drugs and vaccines, and even risk their own bodies to participate in clinical trials that determine both the safety and efficacy of these drugs. But in a preposterous twist, we must then pay exorbitant prices to pharmaceutical companies just to use the very drugs we helped develop. This is in effect socialism followed by highway robbery for Big Pharma, which Azar knows all too well since he infamously more than tripled the price of insulin when he was the Vice President of Eli Lilly. This was in spite of the fact that the doctors who discovered insulin, Frederick Banting and Charles Best, sold their patent for $1 for the public good to help those suffering from diabetes.</p><p>Protecting the rich at the expense of the poor does nothing to fight a contagious disease that attacks the weakest and most vulnerable links in society to bring down the whole chain. But even beyond the economic inequality of American healthcare, this brings to the fore an even deeper issue when it comes to our country’s drug and vaccine development pipeline. Republicans have been waging an ideological war against science in the name of religion for many years that has been hampering our efforts to combat new and emerging infectious diseases. Nothing illustrates this case more than the Republican war on medical research involving fetal tissue. </p><p>Throughout history, fetal tissue has been indispensable for developing lifesaving vaccines. Jonas Salk in the 1950s used human fetal kidney cells to incubate the polio virus and develop the polio vaccine, saving countless children from iron lungs. Vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox all come human fetal cell lines. Even our understanding of how HIV causes AIDS comes from studying mice with transplanted human fetal bone marrow, liver, thymus, and lymph nodes to simulate the human immune system.  </p><p>Unfortunately, Republicans have gone to war against fetal tissue research and women’s reproductive freedoms to such an extent that our ability to conduct lifesaving medical research has been severely crippled. I found this out the hard way when two armed US Marshals banged on the door of my studio apartment in Nashville to serve me a Congressional subpoena from then-Congresswoman, now-Senator Marsha Blackburn. Having been a Howard Hughes Medical Institute research fellow at both Stanford and Duke Medical School, I had done research involving fetal kidneys to cure a deadly disease in babies called bilateral renal agenesis. That’s a disease where babies are born without any functional kidneys, and I wanted to find a way to save their lives. But because of it, my entire life was thrown into turmoil and upheaval, ultimately destroying my reputation and any chance of me finishing my surgical residency at Vanderbilt. </p><p>Unfortunately, I was not the only medical researcher targeted by Marsha Blackburn. Dozens of other physicians, graduate students, professors, and ordinary American citizens were subjected to a witch hunt that ultimately ruined careers and squandered some of America’s best and most promising minds. Whereas President Trump makes headlines for firing the National Security Council’s pandemic response team and proposing cuts to the CDC that never materialized, it was Senator Blackburn and her House Select Panel on Infant Lives that truly caused lasting harm to our nation’s preparedness for a pandemic. </p><p>We’ve known about the dangers of coronaviruses since the SARS epidemic in 2002. Yet more than 18 years later we still don’t have a human vaccine for SARS that would have been useful as a blueprint to develop a vaccine for Covid-19. Much of this may be because of the ideological and religious war against fetal tissue hampering progress. In fact, even my own research model could have been helpful for studying the coronavirus, since the human fetal kidney has a high concentration of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors that the coronavirus is known to target to gain entry into our cells.</p><p>After experiencing the Republican war on science on the front lines, I learned that discrimination, innuendo, fear, and suspicion are as much part and parcel of the American way of life as are the lofty ideals of freedom and justice. That’s why there is another aspect of the coronavirus epidemic that truly frightens me to my core. </p><p>As an Asian American physician, I am painfully aware that the coronavirus not only represents a severe public health challenge but also threatens the basic human rights and civil liberties of minorities like me. Social media has already been abuzz with racist memes of Chinese people eating bat soup or rats. It’s not a far leap for Asian Americans to be labeled as infesters like cockroaches.

It was packed to the rafters and that stadium has more people crammed in every year so it is becoming an important race for Formula E.</p><p>But any new viewers trying out Formula E for the first time this Saturday on BBC2 at 13:30 are going to be in for an absolute belter as well with the Circuit Moulay El Hassan a hybrid track – taking part on a traditional motor racing track but spilling out onto normal roads as well.</p><p>I think teams will be coming here on top form with the track the same and with the rookie test having taking place here last year as well so the teams will be full of data and have no excuses from an engineering standpoint.</p><p>I think this race therefore is going to come down to one thing – driver ability.</p><p>You have to look at the usual suspects who have been successful so far – Alexander Sims, Sam Bird, who should have a real fire in his belly after letting slip second place late in Mexico City and ending pointless, and Antonio Felix Da Costa who drove a great second-place in Mexico.</p><p>Yes, Mitch Evans and Panasonic Jaguar Racing are top after winning brilliantly in Mexico but only by a point and I think there might just be an increase in pressure now they’ve had that whiff of victory.</p><p>Fair play to Jaguar, they had a timeline of delivering success after four years and they are where they want to be now but it is a reverse in fortunes compared to previous years and victories are addictive so the pressure will have ramped up on James Barclay and his team and it will be interesting to see how they handle it. </p><p>I’ve said before that I think continued, consistent success this season will crown the Champion. I think we’ll see a team or driver score consistently to take the title and I think that is already coming to fruition.</p><p>Obviously there is a long way to go and everyone in the top-10 is still in with a shout but give or take the likes of current champ Jean-Eric Vergne, former champions Sebastien Buemi and Lucas di Grassi and Andre Lotterer who could still come in I think we know our title contenders.</p><p>It has been a strange start for JEV has almost been propped up a bit by Da Costa this season – I sometimes wonder if the Frenchman is suffering a bit of third-album syndrome. DS TECHEETAH had to replace is best buddy Lotterer when TAG Heuer Porsche came in but Antonio is keeping him competitive because he doesn’t want to play second fiddle.</p><p>It is something team boss Mark Preston will have to handle with cotton wool gloves as they’re both strong personalities, but I think it will be good for JEV in the long run.</p><p>Since leaving DS TECHEETAH I think Andre has done well for Porsche and was unfortunate in Mexico to put the car in pole and then over aggression on the first turn bumped him down - he’d probably look back and think he didn’t do himself any favours.</p><p>But I hope that Andre doesn’t change his style because he is one of the Championship’s main characters – he is a flamboyant Matador, he’s cool and funky, he’s got that confident German swagger yet as a driver he is the opposite and absolutely puts the hammer down.</p><p>So there will be plenty for fans and newbies alike to enjoy this weekend during the first main BBC2 terrestrial broadcast of the season. I’m delighted that motorsport is on terrestrial TV because British people love it and we’re really good at broadcasting it.</p><p>For example, it was great to see my buddie Steve Jones win a Sports Journalist Award for Best Sport Presenter this week for his work in motorsport – for Stevie to pick up that award is a testament to him when we have so much sport on the tele here.</p><p>So for us to broadcast this new form of racing live, on the BBC on Saturday afternoon, it should bring more eyes to the series and with next year becoming a World Championship it will be great for people to see it live and on the BBC. </p>','Vernon Kay','https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/formula-e-motorsport-back-bbc-21598011',58,1,'2020-02-29 20:04:13','2020-02-29 20:04:13',2),(1429636,'how-stress-affects-your-skin-and-what-to-do-about-it--according-to-experts','How stress affects your skin and what to do about it, according to experts','Consequences of emotional tension can play out physically as well as psychologically','W\ne have all experienced stress in some form or another whether that is for a short, or extended, period of time.

This emotional tension stems from unavoidable parts of everyday life, including work, family problems, financial woes and the digital pressures of social media. </p><p>While the anxiety that arises may originally occur in your brain, the consequences can play out physically. And no, we don’t just mean tense shoulders and furrowed brows. </p><p>According to dermatologist Dr Anil Budh-Raja, daily stressors can also manifest in your skin, triggering or worsening a wide range of conditions such as acne, psoriasis, eczema and even hair thinning. “Stress causes a change in brain and body chemistry and has a significant impact on our skin,” Dr Budh-Raja explains, describing the process as the “brain-skin connection”. </p><p>To understand how stress and anxiety can affect the skin, Dr Budh-Raja says we must first understand a little about the endocrine system.</p><p>The endocrine system is comprised of a number of glands that produce hormones and, when everything is in place, it allows the human body to work like a well-oiled machine. However when outside factors, such as stress, intervene this intricate system can slip out of sync. </p><p>During moments of tension the body produces excess cortisol, often referred to as the “stress hormone,” which wreaks havoc on everything from your immune system to blood pressure. “Stress increases cortisol production from the adrenal glands, which in turn increases sebaceous gland activity, to produce more oil and sebum,” Dr Budh-Raja explains.</p><p>“The result can be acne and increased sensitivity of our skin. Cortisol also weakens the skin’s immune system, leading to oxidative stress which manifests itself as wrinkles, lines and lacklustre skin.</p><p>“It also increases inflammation on the body and conditions like eczema, rosacea and psoriasis can flare up.”</p><p>Dr Sarah Coles, a chartered clinical psychologist, agrees, adding that the onset and consequences of stress can often form a vicious cycle.</p><p>“Anxiety and/or stress, which can be caused by skin conditions such as eczema, in fact can exacerbate the condition due to the body\'s inflammatory responses such as producing cortisol or interrupting sleep,” Coles says.</p><p>“Stress can also make us less likely to engage in healthy habits for example we might work longer hours, eat less well, or drink more caffeine and alcohol.”</p><p>When troubles are piling up, it can often feel like the worst time for pimples to populate your face, but they inevitably do. While it can be frustrating science says it makes perfect sense for stress to exhibit itself physically.</p><p>A 2015 study into the effects of stress as a causative or maintaining factor in psoriasis showed that about half of participants said their first experience with the disease came during a particularly difficult time in their lives, while 63 per cent said their symptoms worsened when they felt anxious or under pressure. </p><p>Similarly, a separate 2017 study of female medical students found that for 74 per cent of participants anxiety and stress were exacerbating factors of their acne.</p><p>Thankfully, experts suggest that much of the skin damage caused by stress can be mitigated by focusing on daily moments of self-care.</p><p>When it comes to looking after your skin during periods of extreme stress, Dr Adam Friedmann, a consultant dermatologist, recommends eating a healthy balanced diet, protecting the skin from UV rays using a high factor SPF and incorporating a moisturiser that contains anti-inflammatory ingredients into your skincare routine to help improve any redness, flaking or itching. </p><p>Dr Budh-Raja agrees, advising that anyone with stressed out skin invests in products that contain soothing ingredients such as aloe vera, chamomile, oatmeal, rosemary extract and niacinamide, which restores the surface of skin against moisture loss and dehydration.</p><p>While it is good to know that we can find remedies to help counteract the effects of anxiety on the beauty counter, Dr Coles says it is also important to address the root of the problem and to try and manage stress levels using alleviation techniques such as yoga and meditation.</p><p>“There are lots of ways to manage stress in daily life, for example having a good sleep routine consisting of settling in a dark room with no bright screens an hour before bed and waking up at the same time each day,” Coles says.</p><p>“It is also important to have a good repertoire of coping strategies for managing stress that work for you. I like to think of this as having a menu to choose from as different strategies often help in different situations.”</p><p>She continues: “For some people this might be going for a long walk, spending some time outside, reading, talking with a friend, mediation, Yoga, or some other form of exercise,” before explaining that it is important to remain in control of your fight-or-flight response.</p><p>“It can also be helpful to think in advance about what helps you to feel better before you are feeling stressed as this can make it harder for us to think rationally about what might help us to feel better.” </p><p>BE INSPIRED WITH THE LATEST LIFESTYLE TRENDS</p><p>Register with your social account or click here to log in</p>','@sarah_j_young','https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/stress-anxiety-affects-skin-conditions-acne-psoriasis-dermatologist-psychologist-a9365086.html',12,1,'2020-02-29 20:04:13','2020-02-29 20:04:13',2),(1429637,'son--stabbed-mum--68--to-death-then-killed-himself-in-murder-suicide-','Son \'stabbed mum, 68, to death then killed himself in murder-suicide\'','Northumbria Police believe 68-year-old Janice Woolford was stabbed to death by her son Michael Woolford at a house in Sunderland before he died from a suspected drugs overdose','A 44-year-old man stabbed his mum to death before dying from a massive dose of drugs in a suspected murder-suicide, police say.The horrifying discover','<p>A 44-year-old man stabbed his mum to death before dying from a massive dose of drugs in a suspected murder-suicide, police say.</p><p>The horrifying discovery of 68-year-old Janice Woolford\'s bloodied body was made just after 10am on Wednesday.</p><p>It wasn\'t long before Northumbria Police found a second corpse - that of her son Michael Woolford - at the house in Sunderland.</p><p>A spokesman for the force told ChronicleLive that Michael did not have any obvious injuries but police believe he had taken a large amount of drugs.</p><p>Detective chief inspector Jane Fairlamb said: \"This is a tragic case that has obviously had a devastating impact on Janice and Michael\'s family.</p><p>\"An investigation into the circumstances around the death is ongoing but the evidence we have gathered at this stage suggests it as a suspected murder-suicide.</p><p>\"A post mortem has taken place that has confirmed Janice died from stab wounds but we still need to wait for a toxicology report to confirm that Michael had died of a drugs overdose.\"</p><p>The dead mum and son where named by police today, after the grim discovery at a house in Satley Gardens, in the Tunstall area of the city.</p><p>Police responded to a report by a member of the public, who was concerned for the safety of Janice.</p><p>Janice and Michael were both pronounced dead at the scene.</p><p>Enquiries into the circumstances around their deaths are ongoing but detectives are treating the death of Mrs Woolford as murder.</p><p>They do not believe anyone else is involved.</p><p>DCI Fairlamb added: \"Once we have concluded our investigation then we will provide the coroner with a report.</p><p>\"I would like to reassure members of the community that there is no wider threat to the public and we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident at this stage.</p><p>\"We would ask that the public respect the privacy of the family at what is an incredibly difficult time for them.\"</p><p>* Samaritans (116 123) operates a 24-hour service available every day of the year.

Mother bears typically hunker down with new cubs in dens there from mid-winter to mid-April, with a blanket of snow making them essentially invisible.</p><p>Bears in undetected dens are vulnerable to noise and other disturbances from above — including from heavy trucks used in seismic oil-seeking surveys that could roll over the snowy shelters, said Geoffrey York, one of the study authors and senior director of conservation for Polar Bears International.</p><p>“With large, heavy equipment running around,” Mr York said, there is “a risk of causing a female to prematurely leave her den or actually crushing her in her den — running over the top of it.”</p><p>The Interior Department is nearing a final decision on auctioning drilling rights in the Arctic refuge, with a sale possible this year. Congress ended a decades-long moratorium of oil drilling in the refuge’s 1.56 million-acre coastal plain in 2017, when it ordered lease sales as a way to raise money that could offset tax cuts.</p><p>Since 2004, oil companies operating in northern Alaska have been searching polar bear dens with aerial forward-looking infrared (FLIR) surveys that spotlight hot spots on the snowy terrain. Successful den discoveries have led companies to curtail bridge traffic and shut down operations to protect the mother bears and their cubs.</p><p>However, the accuracy of FLIR survey technique is undermined when conducted in faster-moving planes instead of helicopters, when new snow has fallen, or when weather has warmed, according to the new study. Cracks in sea ice, exposed rocks and abandoned steel drums can throw off false positives, the research says. Even the latest generation of FLIR imagers “will still struggle with the fundamental physics of detecting subsurface heating associated with dens in the presence of strong winds, direct solar radiation, falling or blowing snow, or too-deep snow overlaying the den,” the study authors wrote.</p><p>The research compared data from aerial FLIR surveys in northern Alaska from 2004 to 2016 with data about known dens. Of 33 known dens, 15 of them — or 45 per cent — were detected by the aerial surveys. At the same time, the study documented 19 false positives that prompted companies to take bear-protection steps such as restricting activity and conducting special monitoring.</p><p>The findings dovetail with a separate new study by Interior Department scientists that emphasises the importance of careful planning and bear-detection efforts before geological surveys to limit disturbance to denning female polar bears and their cubs.</p><p>The Washington Post</p><p>Only the best news in your inbox</p><p>Register with your social account or click here to log in</p>','Jennifer A Dlouhy','https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/polar-bears-oil-industry-alaska-canada-oil-drills-a9365396.html',12,1,'2020-02-29 20:04:13','2020-02-29 20:04:13',2),(1429656,'think-the-s-p-500-is-in-bad-shape--its-components-look-worse','Think the S&P 500 is in bad shape?

Further UK cases beyond','<p>A\npassenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan became the first Briton to die of the Covid-19 coronavirus on Friday. Further UK cases beyond the 20 already confirmed are expected, while countries including Mexico, Nigeria and Denmark have announced their first positive tests. The World Health Organization assesses the level of risk as “very high at global level”. But the scale and impact of the Covid-19 outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, in December, remain deeply uncertain. That is because whle viral outbreaks have happened before, each one is different. While severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) had a higher death rate, Covid-19 appears to be more contagious. Its spread is already being determined in hard-to-predict ways by human behaviour.</p><p>To limit the damage as far as possible, trust and information are of the essence. In the UK, as elsewhere, it is imperative that the government, and other public bodies, provide straightforward advice about travel and sanitation as well as the disease. For the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to say earlier this week that he would not travel to northern Italy was unwise because it contradicted official guidance. Instead, ministers must lead by example.</p><p>In recent weeks Boris Johnson has appeared in public rarely. There are circumstances in which a cabinet minister is an effective substitute. But with a threatened pandemic, combined with ongoing floods, leadership is called for. The prime minister, who is often said to have harboured a lifelong ambition to head his country’s government, should now end its petty boycott of key BBC news programmes. It cannot be left to backbench Conservative colleagues such as the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt to encourage people to deal with these unpredictable events in a responsible way. This is all the more important when xenophobic outbursts have been reported, and when the risks associated with panic behaviours such as stockpiling are well known.</p><p>It is a missed opportunity and a mistake by Mr Johnson not to have called a Cobra meeting before Monday. Governments, businesses and institutions of all sorts face difficult decisions, based on balancing risks. Broadly speaking, these are the dangers of Covid-19 itself, weighed against the disruption caused by any measures, such as school closures or travel restrictions, that are taken to limit its spread. Individuals can find themselves confronting similar dilemmas and, within the parameters set out by advice from councils or employers, will behave differently. “Social distancing”, meaning avoiding hugging and kissing, is recommended. But the threat is not the same for everyone. While fit young adults are likely to recover should they catch Covid-19, older people and those with underlying health conditions are more vulnerable. Every family will contain people with different susceptibilities.</p><p>Beyond the immediate risks to health, experts warn that a recession is likely. Markets have had their worst week since 2008 and central banks are less able to act in the face of a supply-side shock such as this, than they are when demand weakens. The unpredictability of the disease is magnified in the reactions to it of our interconnected global economic systems. It is impossible, too, to know what the political impact will be, except that it will surely be greater if nationalists seek to profit from the disruption to flows of capital, goods and people. But the worst outcomes may still be averted. Political leadership and clear communication are the immediate necessities.</p><p>… we’re asking readers, like you, to make a new year contribution in support of the Guardian’s open, independent journalism.

In the UK, som','<p>A\ns the public and governments grapple with understanding Covid-19 and how to curb its spread, sales of hand sanitiser gel have soared. In the UK, some supermarkets have already run out and Boots is rationing purchases to two bottles a customer. But is hand gel really effective against coronavirus? And, if so, should we be making our own if it is not available in the shops or online?</p><p>Hand sanitiser is not new. In 1966, Lupe Hernandez, a student nurse from Bakersfield, California, patented the idea of an alcohol-based gel to clean hands in the absence of handwashing facilities. However, it was not until the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009 that the product went from being used in institutions to something the public carried with them. That year, sales of antibacterial gels and wipes in the US soared by more than 70% in six months. By 2010, little bottles of the stuff were everywhere – from checkout counters in airport bookshops to online retailers offering customisable dispensers.</p><p>The popularity of hand gels has not just been driven by the fear of pandemics. Lucrative opportunities to market them have pushed sales: they now come in pretty, child-friendly colours (bubblegum pink, bright blue) and with wellness-friendly scents (cinnamon, lavender) that are a far cry from the pungent-smelling version found in hospitals.</p><p>Sanitisers have also evolved to include other active ingredients in place of alcohol, and there are recipes online for making your own. Good Housekeeping suggests vodka. Wellness bloggers plump for things such as witch-hazel and aloe vera. But are these effective in killing germs?</p><p>Hygiene experts, the NHS and Public Health England all agree that to kill most viruses, a hand sanitiser requires at least 60% alcohol content (most contain 60-95%). For those with sensitive skin, there are now options that don’t contain alcohol. For decades, there were also versions made with another powerful antibacterial agent, triclosan, which was found in everything from soaps to toothpaste. However, research has since found that triclosan can be detrimental to the body’s endocrine system, and the US Food and Drug Administration banned its use in hygiene products at the end of 2017.</p><p>Sally Bloomfield, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says that viruses are much more resistant to disinfectants than bacteria. Luckily, she says, coronavirus is an envelope virus, meaning it has a coating around it which the alcohol can attack, thereby eliminating the threat. (Norovirus and rhinovirus, by contrast, do not).</p><p>This means that making your own sanitiser, while potentially effective against some bacteria, is not something Bloomfield would recommend. “It’s very unwise, dangerous, even,” she says. Shop-bought products also contain emollients to make them softer on the skin, without which you run the risk of hurting your hands. Getting the mix right at home would very tricky – so it is a big no-no.</p><p>The key thing is when to use hand sanitiser. Covid-19 is a new illness, so no one knows exactly how it spreads. According to the NHS, it is likely that it is through cough droplets spread from person to person and very unlikely that it is transmitted through objects, be that packages or food.</p><p>Bloomfield’s advice is to wash your hands with soap and water – or, if that is not possible, use hand gel – when you return to your “safe place”, by which she means your home, your desk or work station, or your seat on the train or plane, for example. Avoid touching anything you don’t need to touch, and be mindful of what you do touch – such as door handles and bus poles – and if you can’t wash your hands or use gel after coming into contact with things, do not touch your face.</p><p>A virus needs a host – living cells – to reproduce: so don’t rub your eyes, or touch your mouth or any wounds if your hands are not clean. Keep your hands clear until you have access to gel or can wash them.</p><p>The best option is soap and water. According to a 2019 study by the American Society for Microbiology, using running water and soap to wash your hands is more effective than a dab of gel that you have not quite rubbed in.</p><p>Soap has mild antibacterial properties, but it does not kill viruses. It does remove dirt, though, so wet your hands with water, lather them up properly, on both sides, in between the fingers and under the nails, one hand and then the other. Rinse them thoroughly under running water for 20 seconds (or as the NHS puts it, the time it takes to sing Happy Birthday). Rinsing thoroughly is key to washing away any viruses. Dry your hands well with a disposable towel, then use that towel to turn off the tap before throwing it away.</p><p>It might seem counterintuitive, but a study published in the medical journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings in 2012 concluded that, from a hygiene standpoint: “Paper towels are superior to air dryers.” This is because the towels dry your hands more quickly and more thoroughly than dryers do, and contamination happens more through wet hands than dry.</p><p>Lisa Ackerley, a chartered environmental health practitioner, says that stocks of hand sanitiser running low is a problem, but cautions against panic-buying. First, you don’t need to use very much – a little bottle will go a long way. In fact, a spokesman for the chemical products company Kao Corporation reportedly said last week that too much hand gel can cause irritation and skin sensitivity, by drying out the skin and removing natural oils. Damaged skin increases vulnerability to infection, so hand sanitisers, like most things, are best used in moderation – and only when handwashing is not an option.</p><p>As Bloomfield puts it, it is not about being paranoid. She likens the process to vaccinations or wearing seatbelts: it is about being disciplined. While some companies have reportedly banned handshaking and other physical contact in an effort to avoid Covid-19, that is not official guidance.</p><p>It is impossible not to engage with the world, so you just need to be cautious and methodical in your hand hygiene. “If everyone complies with good hygiene,” says Bloomfield, “then you’re making sure as far as possible that you’re not picking it up, and in the unlikely event you are infected you’re not spreading it.”</p><p>... we have a small favour to ask.

Unless the package is adjusted to address the depth and urgency of this crisis, then extinction may be firmly on the horizon,” said the president of the Law Society, Simon Davis.</p><p>“There are increasingly large areas of the country where there are no defence solicitors available. The very notion of British justice is in jeopardy — with victims left in limbo and the accused potentially deprived of a fair trial.</p><p>“Not only will the shortage of practitioners lead to injustice; it is economically unsound. Defence lawyers help ensure the justice system runs efficiently — and in doing so, save the taxpayer money.”</p><p>The right to free access to a lawyer is a pillar of the criminal justice system, and duty solicitors fill that role, representing and advising those suspected or accused of a crime who would otherwise not have access to a lawyer.</p><p>But the average age of duty solicitors across England and Wales is now 47, the Law Society warned, which rises significantly in many areas. </p><p>Only the best news in your inbox</p><p>Register with your social account or click here to log in</p><p>In Norfolk, Suffolk, Cornwall and Worcestershire there are no criminal law solicitors under the age of 35, with only one in west and mid Wales, and two in Devon.</p><p>The Law Society suggested the shortage could be blamed on the fact that defence solicitors have not received a fee increase since 1998, adding: “Combined with other cuts to the system, many lawyers no longer see a viable career doing this work, and it is difficult to attract and retain new members of the profession.”</p><p>Under the MoJ’s proposed reforms, lawyers will for the first time be paid to review unused material — evidence gathered by the prosecution that is disclosed to the defence but is not going to be relied on in the case.</p><p>The material can sometimes run to thousands of pages with lawyers spending up to 24 hours a week reviewing them without getting paid.</p><p>The importance of viewing such documents came under sharp focus from the end of 2017 after a string of defendants including student Liam Allan, who was accused of rape, had charges against them dropped when critical material was discovered at the last minute.</p><p>But the Law Society noted that while the Crown Prosecution Service had recently been granted a 10 per cent pay rise worth £85m, the reforms offered to defence lawyers meant, in real terms, they would actually be earning less than they were when the review was announced in 2018.</p><p>A source told the PA news agency the MoJ’s offer had been “just enough” to keep criminal barristers from walking out on strike again and no one was “happy” but “it’s a start”.</p><p>Caroline Goodwin, chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, described some of the proposals as “derisory”, adding: “We deal, on a daily basis, with serious cases with life-changing consequences for victims of crime, witnesses and defendants, and such a rate needs to recognise this.</p><p>“There is still much to be done but these first steps are welcomed as part of the wider review.”</p><p>These proposed reforms — which will now face a public consultation — were fast-tracked after what the Law Society’s Richard Atkinson described as “significant protest” in 2018, before the MoJ “finally accepted” the urgent need to improve the system sooner than the review’s intended publication date in late summer.</p><p>Announcing the proposals, Mr Buckland said: “[They] are an important first step towards reviewing sustainability in the long term, ensuring fair fees, and delivering value for the taxpayer. </p><p>“I am grateful for the engagement of defence practitioners to get us this far, and I look forward to working with them as we progress.”</p><p>But the LCCSA contended the government had “chosen not to take this opportunity to show good faith and demonstrated yet again that access to justice is not a priority”.</p><p>The group added: “In real terms the package in offer is merely paying lip service to our urgent cry for help and it is the equivalent of Robert Buckland trying to put a sticking plaster over a broken leg.”</p><p>Additional reporting by PA</p>','Andy

They are now pricing in more than an 80% chance of a new 1% to 1.25% Fed target range for short-term borrowing costs by March 18, when the Fed next meets, down from the current 1.5% to 1.75% range.

And this is only possible because we made a different choice: to keep our reporting open for all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford to pay.</p><p>We have upheld our editorial independence in the face of the disintegration of traditional media – with social platforms giving rise to misinformation, the seemingly unstoppable rise of big tech and independent voices being squashed by commercial ownership. The Guardian’s independence means we can set our own agenda and voice our own opinions. Our journalism is free from commercial and political bias – never influenced by billionaire owners or shareholders. This makes us different. It means we can challenge the powerful without fear and give a voice to those less heard.</p><p>None of this would have been attainable without our readers’ generosity – your financial support has meant we can keep investigating, disentangling and interrogating. It has protected our independence, which has never been so critical. We are so grateful.</p><p>As we enter a new decade, we need your support so we can keep delivering quality journalism that’s open and independent. And that is here for the long term. Every reader contribution, however big or small, is so valuable. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

Good thing, too, otherwise the player who grew up kicking rolled-up plastic bags around the streets of Dar es Salaam would not be preparing to lead the line for Aston Villa at Wembley. More than 10 family members will be watching from the stands in Sunday’s Carabao Cup final and millions of his fellow Tanzanians will be cheering him on from farther afield. From Birmingham to east Africa, fans have invested a lot of hope in this 27-year-old. And that is how he likes it.</p><p>Samatta says he always wanted to be someone on whom folks could rely. At first he thought he should become a solider – “Just to be someone for the people, they could look and say: ‘Because of him, we are safe’” – but instead he achieved something far more improbable by becoming, following January’s £8.5m arrival from Genk, the first Tanzanian to play in the Premier League and the centre-forward whom Villa want to fire them to their first major trophy since 1996. Sure, Villa are underdogs but that does not matter to Samatta. Talent and strength of will have taken him a long way.</p><p>The second-youngest in a family of seven children, Samatta has played football for as long as he can remember but by the time he was 17 he knew that he, like his five older brothers, would probably have to give it up and get a proper job. He planned to enlist in the army, even though his footballing ability had attracted the chairman of the local club in Mbagala, the district of Dar es Salaam where he grew up. He joined Mbagala Market in the Tanzanian second division. The wages? None.</p><p>“I was playing football but not really thinking that football is going to take me somewhere,” he recalls. “I played something like two years in the second division and then a company called Mohamed Enterprises came and bought the club [and changed its name to African Lyon] because they were thinking the team could make it to the Premier League. When they bought the team, they started paying salaries. That was the time I started thinking: ‘This can be serious.’ It was just something like £40 or £50 per month but I was thinking: ‘If you get a salary, that means it’s a real job. So I can do this. Let’s see where it takes me.’”</p><p>Soon it took him to Tanzania’s biggest club, Simba SC, for whom he scored 13 goals in 25 matches, including one in an African Champions League tie against the Congolese giants Tout Puissant Mazembe. They swiftly made a move for him. He left his home town for the Lubumbashi base of TP Mazembe in 2011, where expectations were sky high. “Before they signed me they had played in the Club World Cup final against Inter Milan so everybody in their team was very known in Africa. I was just a boy from Tanzania. It was really a bit difficult. But I think my legs helped me. Just getting on the pitch and scoring goals. I scored in my first game.” Then Mazembe sold their main striker, Alain Kaluyituka, to a club in Qatar and Samatta stepped into the gap.</p><p>“It turned out that the players liked me, and the fans also liked me – they wanted to see me play. Because I’m fast and score goals.” With Samatta Mazembe won four successive domestic titles and lifted the 2015 Africa Champions League, with the striker scoring penalties in both legs of the final. “I knew the team looked at me and thought: ‘This is our main man, he will do something.’ So there was not very big pressure to score a penalty in the final. If you feel like you’re confident, you take it.” But the pressure was cranked up when he joined Genk in January 2016.</p><p>“When I was in Belgium, I realised that in Africa it was a little bit easy to play. It’s not aggressive. In Belgium it’s aggressive. The defenders they come at your legs kicking, pushing. In Africa, even if I was not 100%, I could just play. But [in Belgium] if you are not 100%, you are dead. You can’t do anything. I just said to myself: ‘I have to improve a lot. I want really to show it, I don’t want to fail here.’” He says it took him six months to adapt. But once he did so, he thrived.</p><p>His goals helped Genk win the Belgian title in 2019 and persuaded Villa that he could help rescue them in January when their previous striking import from the Belgian league, Wesley, got injured.</p><p>Samatta says he heard of Villa’s interest two days before the transfer was completed. “It was always my dream to play in the Premier League,” he says. “In Tanzania it is our favourite competition. I liked Manchester United because of David Beckham. Then came Cristiano Ronaldo but I switched sometimes to Thierry Henry because I liked how he played. And Didier Drogba, that was the guy I looked at most. I wanted to play like him and I tried to adapt and copy his running and stuff.”</p><p>His first match for Villa was the Carabao Cup semi-final triumph over Leicester but Samatta admits he found the going tough even before that. “Since I joined the team in training I had a feeling like: ‘If I had to be 100% in Belgium, here I have to be 200%.’ It’s not easy! In training they were running over me every time. I couldn’t get it. I was thinking: ‘Wow, this is tough. But I will make it.’”</p><p>In his next game he scored. His goal in a 2-1 defeat at Bournemouth was Villa’s first from a header all season, a particular pleasure for the striker who rates his aerial prowess as a key strength. But he was still not satisfied with his performance. He seldom is. “When the game is finished you go home and try to analyse it. What did I do? What do I have to improve?” His answer to the last question was: “A lot of stuff. But mostly my sprints. If I did 10, I have to get to 20. And where I position myself and how can I help my teammates to find me easily. Or how can I find space.”</p><p>Some particularly zealous Tanzanian admirers concluded that Samatta’s teammates needed to raise their game. The player felt embarrassed when he saw lots of his compatriots contacting other players on social media to order them to give their hero better service. “It’s like now the club and some players are receiving a lot of messages and I just asked them to leave the players alone. It’s me who comes from there [Tanzania], you don’t have to message everybody! Let them concentrate. It’s crazy! I don’t really like it.”</p><p>While Villa are counting – on Sunday and in their fight against relegation – on Samatta adapting rapidly to English football, City’s attack could be led by the most prolific foreign scorer in England in the modern era. Samatta acknowledges Sergio Agüero’s excellence but takes more inspiration from others.</p><p>“Before games I used to always watch videos of top strikers. Every time it used to be Didier Drogba. Then it was Harry Kane. I’ve watched him a lot; how he positions himself. And most of the time when he gets the ball he’s just thinking about shooting.”</p><p>Like Kane, Samatta is the captain of his country. He has found other ways of helping his people feel good. A few years ago he set up an annual charity match with one of Tanzania’s most popular singers, Ali Kiba, using the proceeds to fund education projects. “I was just thinking: ‘OK, I’m doing a job and getting paid but what can I do for society?’ We try to repair problems with schools and give it to people who don’t have anything.”</p>','Paul Doyle','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/28/mbwana-samatta-aston-villa-carabao-cup-final',8,1,'2020-02-29 20:04:13','2020-02-29 20:04:13',2),(1429674,'u-s--congress-offices-advised-to-set-coronavirus-contingency-operations','U.S. Congress offices advised to set coronavirus contingency operations','','WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Members of the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday were advised to establish plans for alternative work arrangements in cas','<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Members of the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday were advised to establish plans for alternative work arrangements in case the coronavirus becomes widespread in the United States.</p><p>“Although we do not have current indications of widespread infections in the United States, your office should consider continuity of operations (COOP) planning in the event of a widespread outbreak,” House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving wrote to lawmakers.</p><p>This could include “telework” arrangements for congressional staff, according to a separate communication from the House Administration Committee.</p><p>Reporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Sandra Maler</p>','Unknown','https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-china-health-usa-house/u-s-congress-offices-advised-to-set-coronavirus-contingency-operations-idUKKCN20M33S?il=0',9,1,'2020-02-29 20:04:13','2020-02-29 20:04:13',2),(1429676,'prosecutors-raid-costa-rican-president-s-offices-in-data-privacy-investigation','Prosecutors raid Costa Rican president\'s offices in data privacy investigation','','SAN JOSE (Reuters) - Prosecutors raided the headquarters of Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado on Friday as part of an investigation into possible ','<p>SAN JOSE (Reuters) - Prosecutors raided the headquarters of Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado on Friday as part of an investigation into possible data privacy violations by the government, the public ministry said.</p><p>Alvarado and seven other high-level officials were being investigated for violating personal data laws and abusing their authority in creating a data analysis unit aimed at helping the president’s policy-making decisions.</p><p>Alvarado’s spokeswoman said the president denied the charges and would cooperate with the investigation.

skiing trip to Italy.</p><p>She has been warned she faces a fine as her daughter\'s absence will be classed as unauthorised but is refusing to back down, North Wales Live reports.</p><p>The Government\'s Chief Medical Officer has said that people returning from Italian towns placed in a \"lockdown\" area should self-isolate.</p><p>But the Ysgol Friars students visited an area 100km (62 miles) outside of this zone.</p><p>She said: \"I agree that the pupils visited a non-locked down area of Italy but at the time they visited no areas in Italy were locked down at that point of which could potentially mean that any infected people from the infected areas of Italy could have been visiting the same area as the pupils and could have unwillingly and potentially transmitted the

personalised newsletter.</p><p>Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean are Olympian best friends and the king and queen of Dancing on Ice.</p><p>So, ahead of this weekend’s semi-final, where the four remaining contestants – Perri Kiely, Ben Hanlin, Joe Swash and Libby Clegg – will dance twice, we squeezed the pair for show secrets.</p><p>From the fall-out between model Caprice and skater Hamish Gamin, whether they miss razor-tongued Jason Gardiner, the time Chris said they were “copulating” like Fred and Ginger to a possible leap-year proposal, here 62-year-old Torvill and 61-year-old Dean reveal all.</p><p>Is there a Dancing on Ice moment you’ll never forget?</p><p>Jayne: “Todd Carty’s moment of fear and humour always makes the TV gold moments – not that it’s representative of the show.”</p><p>Chris: “Libby Clegg’s first routine was a very moving moment. It was all about what Libby had achieved and the mountains she’d climbed to get to that point. I was hoping she could see, in her mind’s eye, what we were seeing and how amazing it was.”</p><p>Do you have a wish list of celebrities you’d love to sign for Dancing on Ice?</p><p>Chris: “Margot Robbie. She’d be my first choice. And she can skate by the looks of things.”</p><p>Jayne: “I always say David Beckham.”</p><p>Would you ban any celebrities from Dancing on Ice?</p><p>Jayne: “No, everyone’s welcome. As long as they work hard.”</p><p>Chris: “Not at the moment…”</p><p>Are you still in touch with any former Dancing on Ice celebs?</p><p>Jayne: “There are one of two we stay in touch with. Ray Quinn, James Jordan has been back to the show, Jake Quickenden and of course we’ve got John Barrowman back now. And David Seaman’s stayed friends with the Dancing on Ice family.”</p><p>How do the judges and presenters prepare pre-show?</p><p>Chris: “We do a dress rehearsal and get to see the celebrities for the first time, which gives us a heads-up to what they’re doing. That’s like figure skating – you watch preps for around a week beforehand. It’s a great thing because a lot of times you’ll see people stepping up on the night and performing better.”</p><p>Jayne: “I like to have a cup of tea.”</p><p>Chris: “I don’t like to have too much coffee because there aren’t enough bathroom breaks.”</p><p>Do you hang out when you’re not filming – and are there cliques?</p><p>Chris: “The presenting side is one side of the building, and the skaters and celebrities are the other so we don’t really see them until show time – other than working with them during the week.”</p><p>Jayne: “We mingle more than the other two judges and Holly and Phillip because we’re there during the week.”</p><p>Do you miss Jason Gardiner being on the show?</p><p>Chris: “We always got on well with Jason. He was cordial. He just chose to go on to other pastures and do other things. I think he is doing a one-man show, which he’d always wanted to pursue. So I don’t miss him because he’s doing what he wants to do, and that’s allowed John to come on the show now and we get on with him.”</p><p>Jayne: “Good luck to Jason. He’s bound to be missed because he did the show from the beginning – he only missed one year.”</p><p>How do you feel about Hamish and Caprice breaking up their partnership?</p><p>Jayne: “We didn’t really get involved in it. We were told what was happening. So we just had to go with it and accept it.”</p><p>Chris: “It was information passed on to us. It just sounded like they weren’t getting on. Caprice wanted to stay in the competition and that was the only way they could resolve it. So that’s what the producers decided to do.”</p><p>Did it have an effect on the atmosphere on the show?</p><p>Chris: “Everyone was, to begin with, asking, ‘What’s happening?’ But now everybody’s really concentrating on their own performance and what they have to do. You’d be surprised – everyone needs to be somehow blinkered on what they need to do. They’re serious about trying to do their best so nobody really dwells on any distractions.”</p><p>Jayne: “Mostly partnerships do have to get on. When you bring it to the ice, there has to be equal respect and trust. And so you have to make that work. And usually, in partnerships where that doesn’t happen, they don’t last that long in the competitive world.”</p><p>Can you share any backstage gossip with us?</p><p>Jayne: “Perri doesn’t even know how to take a hair grip out because they’re in so rigidly.”</p><p>Chris: “Some of the other celebrities are a bit hyper before they go on – that’s the way they are. They need that hyperactivity to keep on top of the nerves. Joe Swash is like that.”</p><p>What’s your worst on-air gaffe?</p><p>Chris: “One year I was doing a routine in tribute to Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and tried to say we weren’t trying to copy them, we were trying to emulate, but it came out as, ‘We’re trying to copulate like them’.</p><p>“And on tour, one of the skaters’ pants split from ear to ear from the waistband during a serious piece with 10,000 people in the audience. It was a classical number in Australia and the audience erupted with laughter.”</p><p>Jayne: “Basically you could see his bottom.”</p><p>Chris: “And we had another girl whose top went. So she did her performance with one hand across her chest, changing hands to not expose herself but carrying on with the choreography like a true pro.</p><p>“Pamela Anderson also had a little exposure moment in the middle of a lift.”</p><p>What’s the best – and worst – thing you’ve each done in their relationships?</p><p>Jayne: “I’ve damaged Chris a few times with my blades. None of that was on purpose.”</p><p>Chris: “A long time ago when I was a police officer, I chased after Jayne in the car and pulled her over for a bit of fun.”</p><p>Chris: “The best thing is that we’re still best friends and skating 47 years down the road. At our age, most people wouldn’t be doing what their sport was their whole life. Luckily, we’re able to still do it.”</p><p>What’s the best – and the worst – gift you’ve ever received from your other half?</p><p>Chris: “Ooh, I’m not going to say that. That’s for me to know!”</p><p>Jayne: “I’ve had so many lovely gifts from my husband. Lots of jewellery and stuff. He’s very good at remembering stuff I’ve mentioned during the year and he’ll remember it during the year.”</p><p>Chris: When we go on tour and someone gets a bit of a naff souvenir, like a gnome, then gift it to you.</p><p>It’s a leap year. So Chris, do you think Karen (his partner of nine years and Dancing on Ice coach) might do a leap year proposal?</p><p>Chris: (Lots of laughter). “I have no idea.”</p><p>Jayne: “I could put her up to it!”</p><p>Dancing on Ice is on ITV at 6pm on Sunday.</p>','Julie McCaffrey','https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/jayne-torvill-christopher-dean-spill-21600448',58,1,'2020-02-29 20:04:13','2020-02-29 20:04:13',2),(1429686,'how-coronavirus-could-impact-mass-gatherings-like-glastonbury-and-tokyo-olympics','How coronavirus could impact mass gatherings like Glastonbury and Tokyo Olympics','Upcoming major world sports events and concerts from the Royal Ascot and Glastonbury to the Tokyo Olympics could be affected by the novel coronavirus outbreak','Japan is insisting the Tokyo 2020 Olympics will go ahead as the global coronavirus outbreak threatens plans for major sporting events and concerts.Tok','<p>Japan is insisting the Tokyo 2020 Olympics will go ahead as the global coronavirus outbreak threatens plans for major sporting events and concerts.</p><p>Tokyo has no Plan B for this year\'s Summer Olympics despite alarm over the spread of Covid-19 in Japan and elsewhere with just five months to go before the event, a senior official said today.</p><p>That\'s despite fears mass gatherings around the world could face postponements or cancellations for months as countries grapple with the spread of the virus.</p><p>\"There will not be one bit of change in holding the Games as planned,\" Katsura Enyo, deputy director general of the Tokyo 2020 Preparation Bureau at the city government, told Reuters.</p><p>Japan has invested more than £9 billion and years of planning into its turn hosting the coveted Olympic Games event.</p><p>Japan is eager to quell fears the Games might be called off, postponed or moved to a different location due to the virus, as the country tops 200 cases and five deaths so far.</p><p>International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach bolstered Tokyo\'s stance on Thursday, saying his organization was \"fully committed\" to holding the games on schedule.</p><p>Yet earlier this week Disneyland Tokyo was temporarily forced to close due to fears over the spread of coronavirus.</p><p>The Disneyland and DisneySea parks in the Japanese capital will remain closed until at least March 15, the company announced today.</p><p>Brits are being warned fears about the virus may now impact events later on in the year -
